# Implementation status — 1 November 2026

This is a working first backend build. The agreed final school application is larger than this implementation. An endpoint below is ready only within the limits stated here and in [API.md](API.md).

| Area | Implemented | Still to build or validate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared access | Activation, login, password setup/change, verified email change, saved-code/email recovery, opaque rotating sessions, allowed school/role/child selection, recent reauthentication, private recovery-code rotation, sessions and preferences | Assisted recovery when all private proofs are lost; external abuse/rate-limit controls; comprehensive breached-password screening; end-to-end native device testing |
| School isolation | Current server-checked permissions, school-scoped SQL, separate service databases/users, explicit child/payer checks, distinct sender-to-receiver service keys, no trusted client identity headers | Independent security review, deployment network policies, production monitoring and backup/restore exercise |
| School setup | Operator creates school and first principal; sessions, three terms, class arms, subject catalogue, versioned metadata | Office/accounts staff account onboarding, full permissions administration and school lifecycle |
| Enrolment and parents | Atomic child/placement/verified guardian link, optional explicit link to an existing login, account provisioning through outbox, pending-account slips, child link revocation, staff/family-safe reads | Additional-guardian management UI/API, changes/transfers/withdrawals, duplicate review workflow and bulk enrolment |
| Teachers | Registration with eligible subjects/levels and actual class assignments; account provisioning and attendance-teacher assignment | Complete edit/deactivation/reassignment workflow, staff invitations for every preset, substitute teachers |
| Timetable | Weekly draft, teacher/class/room conflicts, fixed break/sports/PT reservations, required periods review, principal publication, class/department/teacher/family reads and publication notifications | Draft listing, lesson edits/removal and an easier revision editor; automatic generation; live conflict tests across multiple app instances |
| Attendance | Assigned teacher's dated roster, drafts, complete submit, submitted-only office overview with missing-register coverage, reasoned office corrections, reviewed absence alerts, own-child history | Repeated-absence flag for 3 absences in 10 teaching days, richer reports/exports, substitute duty workflow |
| Examination rules | Tested 20/20/60 calculation, A–F grade bands and annual promotion recommendation function | Marks entry/submission/review, class-teacher remarks, principal report publication, report-card PDFs, assessment calendars, corrections to published results |
| Promotion/graduation | Tested recommendation arithmetic and incomplete-evidence review | Execution/approval records, next-session placement, JSS3 pathway decisions, SSS3 completion and graduation workflows |
| Fees | Immutable issued invoice lines, NGN integer amounts, partial payments, reasoned cash/verified-bank records, permanent reference uniqueness and receipts in invoice detail | Fee plans, bulk issue, credits/discount approvals, refunds, full bank/provider settlement reconciliation and accountant onboarding |
| Paystack | Test hosted checkout, signed raw webhook intake/deduplication, authoritative verify, retryable unknown outcomes, exact-once local allocation and exception listing | Live mode is deliberately rejected; actual test-account/subaccount validation, external webhooks and settlement work remain |
| Communication | In-app private notifications/read status, school-wide notices, parent complaint cases/replies/internal notes/reasoned closure, teaching-day first-response target | Class-targeted notices, parent/teacher message threads, attachments, case reassignment/escalation and school-office walk-in complaints |
| Email and push | Encrypted private mail queue, opt-in configured SMTP delivery, expiry/retry states; encrypted push-device registration | Real email-provider validation; mail-worker leasing before running multiple Communication instances; native push-provider delivery and delivery receipts |
| Calendar/history | Session/term dates, teaching-day exceptions, academic audit endpoint and histories for implemented commands | Calendar list/editor, whole-school history screen, immutable storage/retention policy and unified cross-service audit queries |
| Imports/exports and assignments | No application endpoints yet | CSV preview/validation/confirm imports, scoped CSV/PDF exports, assignment creation, student submissions and teacher feedback |

The normal first-school account is **PRINCIPAL**. Teacher, student and parent provisioning is implemented. Having role checks for `SCHOOL_OFFICE` or `ACCOUNTS` does not mean their account-management screens or onboarding endpoints are finished. Current Finance read endpoints do not include the proposed office read-only preset.

## Verified evidence

The application build passed **30 unit tests** and **19 integration scenario groups** with all five Java programs and real PostgreSQL. The tests cover multi-school and selected-child isolation, enrolment races/retries, account linking/revocation, timetable conflicts/publication, submitted attendance/corrections, payment verification/deduplication, complaint privacy, recovery, refresh replay and service key separation.

The passing application run is [GitHub Actions run 41322519058](https://github.com/ayodamolami4-bot/educore-frontend/actions/runs/41322519058). That run predates the additional Compose startup checks; the workflow attached to later commits shows their result separately. Paystack HTTP and SMTP were local test doubles. No live money moved, no actual external email was delivered, and no cloud API or app-store build was deployed.

The database development project prepared separately is not proof that the applications are connected to a hosted database. The tested runtime uses four fresh databases in CI; local Compose provides the same four-database layout.

## Next delivery order

1. Add office/accounts onboarding, teacher changes, timetable editing and parent-link management so the current workflows have complete administration screens.
2. Build the examination chain: subject teacher submits, class teacher reviews/remarks, principal publishes, families read the published report.
3. Add promotion/graduation execution using published results, then assignments and submissions.
4. Finish fee plans/adjustments/settlement reconciliation, targeted messaging, import/export and deployment hardening.

Build each workflow with its API, permitted roles, history, failure states and real-database tests before marking the corresponding frontend screen connected.
